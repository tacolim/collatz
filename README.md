##Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics. 

The theory is that starting with a positive integer and putting it through a set sequence it will always terminate back down to 1. 

The sequence is: until terminus, if the number is even divide by 2. If it's odd multiply by 3 and add 1. 

Negative integers behave similarly, they always terminate with a repeating sequence less than zero.
